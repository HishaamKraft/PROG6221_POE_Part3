# PROG6221_POE_Part3
# Project Name: 
Recipe Manager (Portfolio of Evidence Part 2)

# Description: 
This program allows users to input recipes, including ingredients and cooking/baking steps, and provides functionality to scale and reset the recipe quantities.

# Link to GitHub repository: 
https://github.com/HishaamKraft/PROG6221_POE_Part3

# Compilation instructions:
1. Open Visual Studio - Launch Visual Studio from the Start menu or by double-clicking its icon.
2. Clone the Repository - Using the options menu on the top of your screen once in Visual Studio, go to "Git > Clone Repository..." and copy and paste the link provided to the GitHub repository in the section that says "Repository location" and follow the necessary prompts if any.  
3. Open the Project: In Visual Studio, go to "File > Open > Project/Solution..." and navigate to the directory where you cloned the GitHub repository. Select the solution file (.sln) of the C# project and click "Open".  
4. Build the Solution: Once the project is loaded in Visual Studio, you can build the solution by going to "Build > Build Solution" or pressing "Ctrl + Shift + B". Visual Studio will compile the code and generate the necessary output files.

# Instructions to run the program:
1. Run the program - Once the build is successful, click on the green play button on the top of the screen in Visual Studio to run the program. The solid green play button will run the program with the debugger attached to it and the hollow green play button will run the program without the debugger attached to it.
2. Understanding console interaction - The program is a console application. A window will pop up once any of the two green play buttons are clicked to run the program with a menu displaying different options for the user to choose from. If you are unable to interact with the console and select a menu option, make sure to click anywhere on the console to acquire console window activation. Once the cursor starts flashing you will be able to interact with the console.   
3. Follow the prompts - Once console window activation is acquired, select any of the menu options and follow the prompts that are displayed in the console window.

# Changes implemented based off of part 1 lecturer feedback:
1. The program now displays a list of menu options that the user can choose from and the program continues to display this menu continuosly until the user selects the option from the menu that allows them to exit the program.
2. Each recipe can now have a name that will be entered by the user.
3. The program follows a more object oriented approach, having different classes with many different methods, rather than a procedural approach.
